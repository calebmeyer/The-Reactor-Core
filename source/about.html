<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Caleb. I'm a software engineer sometimes, and a devoted husband and father all the time. I mostly do ruby on rails and react for $WORK, but I learned some C and Java in college, and I do side projects in the fastest growing and most loved languages (python and rust, respectively). I'm an avid gamer, and play lots of board games and video games. I'm also a big font nerd, and one of those crazy vim mode types.

<h2>About this Blog</h2>
<em>Where'd the name come from?</em>
<p>If you've ever played any of the Mass Effect games, all of the engineers hang out at the reactor core at the back of the ship.</p>

<em>Why did you pick <span style="color: #d3fc05;">chartreuse</span> (bright yellow green)?</em>
<p>I also have played a bunch of modded minecraft, and yellorite/yellorium are this color. Combined with the warmer gray I'm using for the background, it feels nuclear to me.</p>

<br />

<em>How did you make the <span class="glow">glow effect</span>?</em>
<p>Some googling and stack overflow. You can see <a href="https://github.com/calebmeyer/The-Reactor-Core/blob/f5b8989f02c93b0070be5cf11199372075fc0d1c/source/static/base-styles.css.scss.liquid#L109-L122">the full CSS here</a>, but it's basically an animation using the <code>text-shadow</code> property.</p>

<br />

<em>What's that thing at the bottom? Some kind of diamond?</em>
<p>Yes! That is actually made using the html escape for diamond. The proper name for it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(typography)">Tombstone</a>, or QED mark for the latin <em>quod erat demonstrandum</em>, literally "which was to be demonstrated". It's used to indicate that you've reached the end without resorting to long-winded rambling <small>on and on about nothing in particular <span style="font-size: 0.8em">until people stop reading...</span></small><p>
