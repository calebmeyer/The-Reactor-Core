# Welcome
Hi, I'm Caleb. Welcome to my blog. I'm going to put my thoughts here. You should start a blog, too, so people can read your thoughts. [Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) will tell you you're not worthy to have a blog. Don't listen to it. Listen to cool people like [Chris Krycho](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/index.html), who inspires me, and gave me the idea to try [Eleventy (11ty?)](https://www.11ty.dev/) for my static site generator. Thanks also to [Andre Bogus (better known as llogiq)](https://llogiq.github.io/) for putting his incredibly well formatted and simple blog into the public domain. I have shamelessly copied some of his CSS.

All the other HTML and CSS around here is hand-crafted by yours truly, so you know who to talk to if it's not that great. There's a surprising amount of yak shaving that goes into creating a website like this by hand, from scratch. For example, your css `@media` queries don't work unless you also have a meta viewport tag, like `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`. You can set a min and max scale here, but on behalf of all our grandparents, please don't. It's horrible for accessiblity.

# What are you going to post here?
Who knows? Could be anything. If you've gone to my about page, you can see what I'm interested in. I learned Java in college, but I hated that you needed 5-10 lines just to write hello world to the terminal. I rebelled and picked python whenever I was allowed to. I still do for any projects that are purely for fun. Django is awesome, requests is a joy, and jupyter is something unique and special all its own. Readers coming here from the rust language community will probably recognize the two names I dropped above. I'm still learning rust (slowly, in the little spare time I have), and it looks like it's well positioned as the best modern language for a large variety of things. I do ruby and rails for my day job, with a heavy dose of react and ES6 on top.

In addition to programming, I also like to write (surprise!), read, and play games of all sorts. I like abstract thinky strategy board games like Azul, Splendor, and Reef. I like action platformer video games, especially metroidvanias, and factory builders like Factorio and Satisfactory.

I might talk about many of the above things. I might go off on a tangent about math, or science, or modern events. It's hard (as a writer), to nail yourself to a genre or category before you've even really started. I do expect many of my posts to be slightly rambly, though I will try to at least provide headings as an outline so you can skip to the good parts.

Thanks for reading, and please feel free to fork and PR [this repo](https://github.com/calebmeyer/The-Reactor-Core) if you catch any spelling, grammar, or usage mistakes (or other mistakes).
