<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Caleb. I'm a software engineer sometimes, and a devoted husband and father all the time. I mostly do ruby on rails and react for $WORK, but I learned some C and Java in college, and I do side projects in the fastest growing and most loved languages (python and rust, respectively). I'm an avid gamer, and play lots of board games and video games.

<h2>About this Blog</h2>
<em>Where'd the name come from?</em>
<p>If you've ever played any of the Mass Effect games, all of the engineers hang out at the reactor core at the back of the ship.</p>
<br />
<em>Why did you pick chartreuse (bright yellow green)?</em>
<p>I also have played a bunch of modded minecraft, and yellorite/yellorium are this color. Combined with the warmer gray I'm using for the background, it feels nuclear to me.</p>
